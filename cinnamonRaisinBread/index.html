	<p>If there's one thing I could have over and over again and not get tired of, it is cinnamon raisin bread. The sweetness of the cinnamon brown sugar combined with the soft texture of the bread is to die for. Pepperidge Farm's Swirl Cinnamon Raisin bread was a childhood staple of mine, so when I found this recipe, I was so excited! The Pioneer Woman's recipe was easy to follow and didn't take much time at all to make. If you're like me, and you love cinnamon raisin bread, then you'll love this recipe! Enjoy! </p>

	<p>The first step to making any bread is the yeast. Unfortunately, yeast has had a bad reputation of being difficult to work with and unreliable. In my experience working with yeast, I have not had any problems. You just have to pay attention to the kind of yeast you are using and the directions that go along with it as there are different types: instant, active dry, and quick rise. For this recipe, I used active dry yeast. The difference between active dry yeast and instant yeast is that with active dry yeast, you need to let it sit in a warm liquid and sugar mixture before combining with the other ingredients versus instant yeast where you can add it directly to the other ingredients.</p>
    <p> To get started, <b>heat the the milk to about 105-110 degrees fahrenheit</b>. I like to heat the milk on the stovetop so I can keep a careful eye on the thermometer. However, you can heat the milk in the microwave if you'd prefer. While the milk is heating on the stovetop, <b>mix the brown sugar and yeast in a bowl</b>. One thing I've learned while working with yeast is that you don't want your bowls to be too cold, as I found this can mess with the temperatuere of the yeast mixture. You can run your bowls under warm water to avoid this problem. Once your milk hits about 105-110 degrees fahrenheit, add it to the brown sugar and yeast mixture. <b>Let your yeast mixture sit, covered with a towel, for 10 minutes until you see a foam start to form on top</b>. This lets you know that your yeast is activated!
