	<p>If there's one thing I could have over and over again and not get tired of, it is cinnamon raisin bread. The sweetness of the cinnamon brown sugar combined with the soft texture of the bread is the perfect combination. Pepperidge Farm's Swirl Cinnamon Raisin Bread was a childhood staple of mine, so when I found this recipe, I was so excited! The Pioneer Woman's recipe was easy to follow and didn't take much time at all to make. If you're like me, and you love cinnamon raisin bread, then you'll love this recipe! Enjoy! </p>

	<p>The first step to making any bread is the  has had a bad reputation of being difficult to work with and unreliable. In my experience working with yeast, I have not had any problems. You just have to pay attention to the kind of yeast you are using and the directions that go along with it as there are different types: instant, active dry, and quick rise. For this recipe, I used active dry yeast. The difference between active dry yeast and instant yeast is that with active dry yeast, you need to let it sit in a warm liquid and sugar mixture before combining with the other ingredients versus instant yeast where you can add it directly to the other ingredients.</p>
    <p> To get started, <b>heat the the milk to about 105-110&#8457;</b>. I like to heat the milk on the stovetop so I can keep a careful eye on the thermometer. However, you can heat the milk in the microwave if you'd prefer. While the milk is heating on the stovetop, <b>mix the brown sugar and yeast in a bowl</b>. One thing I've learned while working with yeast is that you don't want your bowls to be too cold, as I found this can mess with the temperature of the yeast mixture. You can run your bowls under warm water to avoid this problem. Once your milk hits about 105-110&#8457;, add it to the brown sugar and yeast mixture. <b>Let your yeast mixture sit, covered with a towel, for 10 minutes until you see a foam start to form on top</b>. This lets you know that your yeast is activated!

<div class = "text">
	<p>For eggs in any recipe, I like to make sure they are <b>room temperature</b>. You can let your eggs sit out for about 30 minutes to come to room temperature, or, if you would like a slightly faster way, boil some water and pour it into a bowl. Crack your egg into another smaller bowl, and then place that bowl into the bowl with the boiled water. You can check the temperature of the egg by placing a (clean!) finger into the smaller bowl. Once your egg becomes room temperature, add the yeast mixture, unsalted butter, and egg into the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk to combine.</p>

	<p>For the flour, I like to use a scale to measure. I find it to be more accurate than measuring cups. However, if you do not have a scale, make sure to use a spoon to scoop the flour into the measuring cup and then level off. Add the flour and salt to the wet ingredients. Attach your dough hook to your stand mixer to combine the wet and dry ingredients. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a spatula or spoon to roughly combine. Once your dough is combined, add the raisins. </p>

<div class = "text">
	<p>Knead for about 10-15 minutes until your dough starts to slightly pull away from the sides of the bowl. As this is a sweet dough, it will be sticky. So, don't be tempted to add more flour! Remove the dough hook, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place your bowl in a warm area to <b>let the dough rise for about an hour</b>. I also like to put a blanket over the bowl to make sure the dough has a warm environment to rise in. </p>

	<p>Once your dough has doubled in size, it is now time to make the cinnamon brown sugar filling! In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and melted salted butter. Lightly flour your surface to spread your dough out into a rectangle that is 8 inches by 18 inches. If you use a 9x5 loaf pan instead, you would spread the dough into a rectangle that is 9 inches by 18 inches. Once the dough is spread out, spread the cinnamon brown sugar all over the dough rectangle. I find it easiest to use your hands to spread the cinnamon brown sugar filling. </p>

	<p>Roll up the dough tightly - this is where you get those nice swirls! If you feel that the dough is becoming loose as you're rolling, pull back the dough slightly and start rolling again. </p>

<div class = "text">
	<p>To grease the loaf pan, I like to spread some vegetable oil around the pan and then lightly cover with flour. Add about a teaspoon of flour into the loaf pan, and tap the pan to move the flour around. Dump out the excess flour by turning the loaf pan upside down and tapping the bottom of it. You can also use nonstick cooking spray if you want a simpler method. Place the roll seaside down into the greased pan and cover lightly with plastic wrap to <b>let rise for about 30 minutes</b>. </p>

<div class = "text">
	<p>Once your dough has risen for about 20 minutes, preheat your oven to <b>375&#8457;</b>. If you are using a 8x4 loaf pan, bake your bread for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top. If you are using a 9x5 loaf pan, bake your bread for 40-50 minutes. If your oven is finicky or you are worried about overcooking the loaf, bake 5 minutes less than the times stated. To check if your bread is cooked completely, remove it from the pan and tap the bottom. If you hear a hollow sound, then you're good to go! Let cool for 15 minutes on a wire rack before slicing, and then enjoy (and try not to eat the whole loaf)!</p>
